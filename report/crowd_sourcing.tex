\section{Crowdsourcing}

To analyse the accuracy of the categorization, the crowdsourcing method has been used.

\subsection{Data}
For each emotion class, 20 tweets are randomly extracted as a sample. The contributors are asked to judge the emotion of the provided content.

The crowdsourcing process is performed on \textit{Figure Eight} platform. A sample of the input data is shown in Figure \ref{data_sample}.

    \caption{Data Sample}
    \label{data_sample}
\end{figure}

The text extracted from the tweets are the only contents that are provided to the contributors. 

\subsection{Question}

\end{figure}

The question design for the crowdsourcing is shown in figure \ref{question}. We provide the text to the contributors and ask them about what the author's sentiment of this post is.

\subsection{Quality}

In order to guarantee the quality of the judgement, some test questions has been created manully in the process of crowdsourcing. The missed percentage and number of judgment are shown in Table \ref{test_questions_table}.

\begin{table}[ht]

\subsection{Accuracy Result}

From the result of the crowdsourcing, we can roughly calculate the accuracy of the classfication.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../"accuracy".pdf}
    \caption{Accuracy}
    \label{accuracy}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{accuracy}, the class with the highest accuracy is happy, and the class with the lowest accuracy is pleasant. The overall accuracy is around 0.3. This may be caused by the fact that many words from the NRC lexicon have emotional overlaps, and the difference between happy, pleasant, surprise is vague.

\section{Conclusion}

In this assignment, an emotion annotated data set from Twitter has been built. The strategies of classfication has been shown, and the crowdsourcing has been used to check the accuracy. In the result, we find that different classes have different accuracy, and this is probabily caused by emotional overlaps of the keywords.
