\section{Introduction}

\renewcommand{\lstlistingname}{Code}

In this course work, the task is to build an emotion	annotated data set from Twitter. This report contains three sections. In the first section, packages used in the codes and the time of data collection will be listed. Then, the methods of crawling tweets, content pre-processing and categorizing will be discussed. Finally, there will be some analysis based on crowdsourcing results.
